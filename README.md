# Penetration-Testing-Lab---Jangow-VM

## Objective
The object of this lab is to gain root access to the system and present the flag stored on the system.

### Requirements
This lab required the following in order to attempt:
  1) Vmware Workstation (This is my preferred Hypervisor of choice, you can as well utilize VirtualBox) I am using Virtualbox for the Vulnerable machine and VMware for the attacking machine
  2) Kali Linux (I utilize the preconfigured Kali images found at [osboxes.org](https://www.osboxes.org/vmware-images/) to save time on having to do a complete install)
  3) Jangow VM found at vulnhub.com at the following link >>>
  (**Disclaimer: This Virtual Machine was created by the user,  and I have no claim/credit to any part of its development**)
